# Gaps and risks — living tracker

Extracted from [assessment.md §6](assessment.md#6-gaps-and-risks) so it can be
updated as the reimplementation lands. Severity is for the first cut (parity
on the `propagate()` path, in-process transport). `Status` is the only column
expected to change.

| # | Gap | Severity | Mitigation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **No native `openai`, `azure`, `bedrock` providers in jaato.** OpenAI, xAI, DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, MiniMax, Mistral, Kimi, Groq are reached through `openrouter`; a self-hosted or third-party OpenAI-compatible endpoint through `nim` / `vllm` with a `base_url`. Azure OpenAI and Bedrock have no route. | medium | profile sets bind `openrouter` first; Azure is a base-URL + header variant of the OpenAI-compatible base class, Bedrock a new adapter. Not needed for the first cut. | open |
| 2 | **Pipeline resume is driver code, not a framework feature.** jaato persists sessions, not pipeline position. Granularity is the driver's choice: stage-level, or finer than upstream by having one session `signal_completion` per sub-stage and be driven again on the same history (assessment §4.8). | low | `ta_cascade/journal.py`: journal per stage, per debate turn, per sub-stage; clear on success. | planned |
| 3 | **Provider quirks the upstream client layer carried** (DeepSeek `reasoning_content` round-trip, MiniMax `reasoning_split`, content-block flattening) are per-model checks against jaato's own quirk tables. | low–medium | smoke each model a profile set names; `quirks:` is the escape hatch. | open |
| 4 | **Structured-output reliability on small models.** A model that never calls `signal_completion` burns `max_turns` and returns nothing. | medium | `on_exhausted: allow` on every processor; a `REVIEW` sentinel rather than a silent `Hold`; `strict_tools` where the upstream supports it; `max_turns` per stage from a dry run. | planned |
| 5 | **Per-stage session cost.** In-process a session is a `JaatoSession` construction; in daemon mode each stage claims a warm pool slot (~7 s). | low | in-process for the library path; daemon only when observers or multi-tenant isolation matter. | accepted |
| 6 | **Prompt-cache locality.** Each stage is a fresh session with its own system prompt; cross-stage reuse is nil, same as upstream. | none | — | accepted |
| 7 | **Vendor config scope.** A process-global vendor config would forbid two concurrent runs with different vendors in one process. | low | the reimplementation passes a `DataConfig` explicitly into the tool factory; no module-level singleton. | planned |
| 8 | **Licence — only for what is copied.** This repository is a *reimplementation*: nothing from TradingAgents is copied verbatim, so Apache-2.0 attaches to nothing here. The architecture is an idea; the paper is cited as a courtesy. jaato's BUSL-1.1 governs redistribution of the port itself. Not legal advice. | note | keep it a reimplementation: write personas, schemas, data layer and decision log fresh. | policy |
| 9 | **`mcp` version mismatch in the dev venv** produces a harmless traceback on every `jaato-scaffold` call. | none | pin `mcp` when the daemon path is used. | open |
| 10 | **Host tools are attach-bound.** They live in the driver process; a cold session cannot use them until a client attaches (`session.wake` → `DEFERRED`). | low in-process; medium for daemon deployments | a `ToolPlugin` packaging of the data layer for daemon deployments (Phase 3). | open |
| 11 | **`echo` cannot script a multi-turn tool loop** (one call, then text). Driver-level tests cover control flow, journal and processors; the analyst loop is tested against a real model or a recorded provider trace. | low | per-stage echo profiles; `trace.provider_log` for replay fixtures. | planned |
| 12 | **No embedding memory in the free jaato package.** Irrelevant to parity; a future "similar past situations" feature needs a `jaato.embedding` provider or an external store surfaced through a prefetch or host tool. | none for parity | out of scope. | deferred |

Status vocabulary: `open` (nothing done), `planned` (design settled, code pending),
`in progress`, `done` (with the commit that closed it), `accepted` (a cost we
take), `deferred` (out of scope for parity), `policy` (a rule, not work).
